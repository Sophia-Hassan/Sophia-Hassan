## About Me
I'm a passionate web developer with a strong interest in creating user-friendly and efficient web applications. 
## Skills
- Frontend Development: I have experience building responsive and interactive user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm comfortable with frameworks like React.js although I am familiar with other frameworks
- Backend Development: I've dabbled with backend technologies, including Node.js and Express. I understand RESTful APIs and how to create robust server-side logic, as well as proficient knowledge go/golang 
- Database Management: I've worked with both SQL and NoSQL, designing schemas and handling data storage efficiently.
- Version Control: (not to point out the obvious but Git is my go-to tool for collaboration and project management. )
